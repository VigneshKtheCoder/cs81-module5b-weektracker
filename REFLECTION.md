1. Yes I think my predictios were correct since gaming had the highest enjoyment. Also creative activites was the most dominant category since the array had lots of creative categories on it like writing and drawing. Finally, Evening enjoyment was also expected to be high

2. I didn't expect for cooking and writing to be so high in the enjoyment score, as I expected that I'd spend more time on physical activities. 

3. filter() was the most useful one because it let me leave specific patterns alone and test ideas quickly, like filtering for short but high enjoyment sessions. Also, it was easily understandable since it just filters the data and doesn't really transform it like map() does.
